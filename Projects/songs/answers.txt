If we calculate the listener’s audio aura based on the average energy, valence, and danceability of their top 100 songs, their aura would likely be high-energy and upbeat. Many of the top streamed songs from 2018 — such as tracks by Drake, Post Malone, Dua Lipa, and Calvin Harris — tend to have strong beats, fast tempos, and positive vibes.
This suggests an aura that might be described as “vibrant,” “confident,” or “energetic.” The listener probably enjoys songs that are good for dancing and have an overall cheerful or empowering mood.
