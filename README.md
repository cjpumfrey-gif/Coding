# Coding
Welcome! This repository showcases my journey through CS50x and the projects I’ve continued building afterward. It includes coursework, personal experiments, and practical automations I’ve implemented in workplace environments. Together, these projects highlight my growth, problem-solving approach, and commitment to continuous learning and implementing solutions in the workplace!
